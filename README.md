Stop the web of texts! Start a web of things!

This is the main idea of this site. Here you'll find a solution to the majour problem of the internet today. The flood of information has grown to an overwhelming amount. Search for "black cat" in Google produces 80 000 000 pages. When you ask a more specific question like "black cat which lives in London and likes milk" you get rubbish. You get pages that contain all the words:

It is a myth that cats like to be alone the majority of the time. ... If your cat loves milk, it is ok to spoil him with a few sips now and again, ... They are currently living in a "cat safe" room that is completely black at night. ... Abandoned kittens in London rescued! A tale of two kitties by LondonGirl ...

Perhaps it were a better result when you'd get as an answer "We have no information on such cats".

The reason for search failures is that the computer can't understand to which object a word is related to. For example, when you talk about a thing and give it different names. "I like summer and warm weather. I hate winter when it's cold. This story started in my favorite time of year." How can a computer guess that "time" is related to "summer"? There is no way. Computers can't understand human texts because they don't possess human experience.

So the solution is obvious. We must give to computers information about things that come up in our texts. Then they can have a chance to get the message. Ontologies and meta tags are popular now. The only problem is no one wants to give additional efforts explaining to machines what is meant. It is sufficient that humans understand.

We suggest to change the approach to thinking of the internet as a collection of texts. Instead we must view the web as a collection of things. A node in the web is an aspect of a single object. "Cat" is a node and "black" is a node. These two nodes are connected. And they relate to one single cat. Real or imaginary. It is not a general notion of a cat or blackness. In this case the web becomes a semantic database, that can manage search requests like "black cat which lives in London and likes milk".

More articles will follow soon. If you want to dive in now turn on the node panel. You can view the PHP code in file index.php.txt.
